It describes a world where BTC holders, particularly those with significant amounts, face numerous challenges and pressures from governments and societal changes.\n>\n> Key points:\n> 1. BTC Management: BTC is managed through complex layers of protocols to reduce transaction fees. Many big BTC holders have secluded themselves in luxurious estates to avoid theft.\n> 2. BTC Ownership: Only a small percentage of BTC remains in circulation, with most being lost. National governments hold a significant portion, making those who still possess BTC extremely wealthy.\n> 3. Government Intervention: Governments have attempted to regulate and control BTC through various means, including coercion and exchange programs. However, BTC's value remains resilient.\n> 4. Layered Nationalized Systems: Governments develop their own layers of protocols on top of BTC, creating a nationalized system of trading known as \"sadsats\".\n> 5. Cerulean Empire: A powerful entity in this future scenario, holding a vast amount of BTC. Other nations are wary of challenging it due to its BTC reserves.\n> 6. Incentives and Restrictions: Governments incentivize BTC holders to move and relinquish their assets, but crackdowns and restrictions are imposed to prevent BTC holders from leaving.\n> 7. Wealth and Imprisonment: BTC holders are both the wealthiest and most imprisoned class in society, facing constant pressure and surveillance from the state.\n> 8, Individual Stories: The post mentions specific individuals, like King Reagent Arjen, who inherit significant amounts of BTC and navigate the challenges of their wealth.\n> Overall, the post paints a dystopian picture of a world where BTC ownership comes with immense wealth but also significant constraints and risks.

They will send letters when the numbers you send them don't match the numbers they obtained from other sources (like Coinbase), but they'll make (usually reasonable) assumptions about the numbers they see. If your tax return didn't properly dispel those assumptions, you may get a letter like this. A CPA can sort this out for you.\n\nFrom what you're describing, you probably did short term trades and accumulated a bunch short term capital losses and gains, the sum of which is taxed as ordinary income atop whatever your wagie habits got you.

I now have a plan in case life does go wrong (lose my job? ok, drain savings -> Take profits if I'm massively up, else try and drain from the stable investments taking less of a beating). I have tried to construct a portfolio that can allow me to weather severe economic turmoil. That alone has granted me a lot of peace of mind. As far as the rest though? It's hard to say. I believe I'm more capable of recognizing my own euphoria and depression. I was still young when I had that level of money. Life hadn't gotten too real. It didn't feel real. So I made bad calls. \"No way it can ever get that bad\" and then it got much worse. I now realize I can be comfortable NOT hitting the top. Take your winnings, be patient, wait for the right opportunity. Create your targets, stick with it, walk away. I have a tendency to still go halfsies.

There are many more people similar to you who also picked out businesses or crypto that seemed like they were in good shape and going to make money only for them to end up losing all their money. That's why it's gambling. There are always a few winners in gambling who serve to encourage more people to throw their money in. Nobody really knows what to pick with much reliability. You can confirm this by looking at the many different professional investment management groups and seeing none of them are getting returns much or even at all beyond what an S&P 500 tracking index fund would get you in the long term. The ones who beat the market by a lot in the short term like Cathie Wood / Ark Invest also lose a ton more than the market during other periods. And the ones who never really lose compared to the market like Berkshire Hathaway look like pic related compared to the market. That's why you get the advice to buy an index fund. Only other way is being like Warren Buffett was in his very early days where he autistically learned everything there is to know about railroads. If you pick some obscure niche interest and study the crap out of it like it's a full time job every day for a couple years you might get enough inside knowledge to intelligently select some businesses to invest in earlier than the general public. But even then that'd be risky. And aside from knowing the obscure niche interest better than anyone you'd also need to know all about finance. And you could still end up losing it all because of unexpected sudden problems that derail your perfect investment choice like the CEO turning out to be a Jared from Subway type pedophile.

But all the college towns on my list (  ) have things going on independent of the schools. I lived exclusively in college towns until I was 30 and didn’t suffer—by the time I was like 24 or 25 I was basically never in venues that were completely dominated by students. I always managed to find friends my age through work and through hobbies (in my case, mostly music—I played in bands and went to a lot of shows). But I guess I also had the advantage of not being single; my now-wife was a grad student at one of the universities where I worked, so I was in a relationship that wound up lasting starting in my early twenties.

Imagine a world where your smart fridge doesn’t just tell you you’re out of milk—it critiques your dietary choices and suggests a three-course gourmet meal plan, complete with wine pairings. It’s like having Gordon Ramsay in your kitchen, minus the yelling (hopefully). Now, think about social media. You post a selfie, and instead of getting likes and comments from your friends, an AI swarm analyzes it, enhancing it with deepfake-level filters that make you look like a cross between a Marvel superhero and a Vogue cover model. And then it auto-generates a catchy caption in Shakespearean English. #AestheticGoals But hold up, it’s not all rainbows and unicorn emojis. With great power comes great potential for epic screw-ups.

AI starts trading stocks so fast it makes Wolf of Wall Street look like amateur hour. It could either make us all billionaires or crash the global economy faster than you can say “Dogecoin.” And speaking of cryptocurrencies, AI might just invent its own, leaving Bitcoin in the dust and making you wish you’d invested in that AI-coined currency when you had the chance. Education would flip on its head. Imagine a classroom where instead of a human teacher, you’ve got a holographic Einstein AI explaining the theory of relativity in ways that even your goldfish could understand. School essays? Pfft. AI would write them for you in seconds, complete with citations and a bibliography that’d make your professor weep with joy. But here’s where it gets mind-bending: AI starts getting creative. We’re talking novels, symphonies, paintings—all crafted by silicon Picassos and Beethoven-bots. You’d walk into an art gallery and not know if the masterpiece in front of you was painted by a human or an algorithm with a penchant for impressionism. And let’s not forget the most critical aspect of our digital lives: memes. The singularity could usher in a golden age of memes, each one more hilarious and surreal than the last. Imagine AI that understands not just surface-level humor, but deep, intricate layers of irony and satire. Memes so profound, they’d make Nietzsche and Dali proud. So, there you have it: a future where AI doesn’t just assist us—it becomes an integral part of every facet of our lives. Whether it leads to a utopian wonderland, a dystopian nightmare, or just a really, really weird version of normal, one thing’s for sure: it’s gonna be a wild, unpredictable ride.

You either have a valid state from the ground up, or it's all made up. In Ripple's case, it's emphatically the latter scenario. This is problematic, among other reasons, because the validators get to collectively choose what is a valid transition. If we get a magic 80% of validators to agree that your wallet is empty, and mine just grew by the amount you lost, then that's what happens. You'd better hope the validators never feel like that's something that needs to happen. As to the \"trust\" part, Ripple itself doesn't bother pretending it's not a fundamental part of their design, but they claim instead it's a good thing to rely on somehow, despite being one of the critical aspect Bitcoin and all plausible cryptocurrencies made a point to remove. The trusted UNL lists 99% of nodes rely on is fine to deal with occasional rogue validators. It is woefully inadequate to protect from attacks where most validators decide or are coerced into colluding. And there's the post limit, so fuck it. You get it, or you don't.\nI'm done."},{"content":">What they're saying is that once a new ledger is issued, that ledger is considered immutable. And then once they put the next ledger together, that should be considered immutable too. Great. And largely worthless, since it doesn't matter if past ledgers exist or not, let alone whether they're immutable, as evidenced by XRP \"losing\" over 32,000 of its earliest ledgers. \njust because there's multiple ledgers on the blockchain doesn't mean the last ones disappear, again you don't even understand what you're referencing here an entire paragraph over something you don't even understand","refusal":null,"role":"assistant"}],"tools":[],"split":"TRAIN"}

Or if they even back it up at all.\nIn order to self custody well you literally just have to have a basic understanding of cryptography and the mechanics of how cryptocurrencies work.

I knew about Bitcoin back in 2009 when it was first being developed. I spent a lot of time online and thought it sounded very cool. Once Bitcoin existed, it seemed the only real use for it was buying drugs on the dark web via silk road. And since I could get the drugs I wanted in real life, I never bought or mined Bitcoin. I just figured I would use it if I ever bought drugs off the dark web. Then I was amazed when Bitcoin went to $1000 in 2013, but after Mt. Gox was hacked I kind of figured the fad was over, and when it dropped to $100-$200 per btc I didn't even think about buying any. There's actually a photo I have of myself in Las Vegas in the fall of 2014 and behind on a moving electronic marquee is a screen that says Buy Bitcoin...\nMy parents gave me 3 grand to invest when I got out of college in 2013. I told my dad I wanted to put it all in Tesla but he said that was a stupid idea and convinced me to invest in a mutual fund that got less than 2% of growth per year\nI was initially going to buy Bitcoin in the summer of 2017 when it was around $2000 per btc but got drunk with my friend and didn't get around to it. By the time I finally bought in fall 2017 it was around $9000. I lost everything I invested that run anyway\nThe list goes on and on. I've known about the company Nvidia for over a decade, never thought to buy their stock.

I enjoyed my first taste of television animation success as the creator and producer of the Emmy Award-winning series, Rocko’s Modern Life, which aired for thirty years on Nickelodeon and is still syndicated worldwide. Rocko’s Modern Life tells the story of a wallaby from Australia who immigrated to America. I'm also was an award-winning designer and illustrator. At the age of 20, i opened my own studio to do commercial illustration, receiving commissions from national magazines, newspapers, book publishers and commercial clients, and hundreds of advertising agencies and design firms. As well as being a noted animator and designer, artist and author of children’s books. I've been written and illustrated two children’s books, Who Asked the Moon to Dinner? and The Enormous Mister Schmupsle – An ABC Adventure. In 2018, I created a new animated series, 'Let's Go Luna!', broadcast on CBS. In a break with my own previous work, this show has a more educational tone. It follows the global travels of three child characters whose parents own a traveling performance troupe. Leo is an Australian wombat, Andy a U.S. frog and Carmen a Mexican butterfly. Episodes typically focus on one particular country, its culture and language. They are usually two part episodes set in the nation's capital. As a director, writer and animator of award-winning independent films, has been screened at such prestigious international film festivals as Sundance, Annecy, Ottawa, Hiroshima and Italian Antennacinema. My film awards include First Place Italian Antennacinema Award, Focus Film Award, ASIFA Best Animation Award and a Student Academy Award.

This should help you nulinkers a bit. A while back there was a clip that cirulated where a bitcoin maximalist said something to the effect of \"if someone were to solve the oracle problem, it would be worth more than all of crypto\" He then went on to give the standard counterargument that sybill attacks fundamentally prevent resolution of the oracle problem. He was almost right\nHere's the reality: in isolation without external factors this is correct. Put differently: if all of crypto was created de-novo and no data/api providers existed before the advent of chainlink, there would exist an equilibrium at which sybill attacks would be more profitable than delivering quality data or outputs. If this was the case, there are ways of breaking this state, but they involve exchange of value first in a non-deterministic manner and then using the experience from that to bootstrap an oracle network. \nFortunately, before crypto the world did exist. This led to trust systems being developed to reign in this situation (lawsuits, word-of-mouth reputation, the value of name recognition) in a world of non-deterministic interactions. \nFor chainlink this is an absolute blessing. The entwork will launch with actors providing APIs and data that are linked to their real-world names and practices. This means that even outside of the sybill equilibrium, there will be significant pressure to have high quality inputs and outputs.

Turned out nothing cared for doing that anyway, which is why its devolved to memes. Chainlink made many mistakes but they cant really do much about tht. I will say that Sergey made a similar mistake to us(but not a forgivable one in his position) of assuming the industry would screw want to grow and then need Chainlink technologies to do so. He scaled his company too much towards expecting that. So now he has 650 on the payroll, and has been dumping for years to fund that anticipating a market which doesn’t exist. That has exaggerated the poor performance, but its not like other serious projects aren’t doing shit.

I do NOT own any crypto. 2. Crypto DOES have a valid use case. The achilles heel of using gold and silver for international commerce is that it is bulky, costs money to transport (and guard) and needs to be physically verified as authentic every time it gets shipped. (to protect against a switch scam) In the past, people tried to avoid this by centralizing gold storage, (like the NY Fed reserve vault that held gold from many countries) so that the gold can technically change custody status without having to be transported. Using paper certificates (or receipts/cheques) that were redeemable for gold were a step forward as they were much smaller and if destroyed, could be cancelled and reissued. Bitcoin can be transferred in amounts small or large across the world securely, essentially for free. I expect that to facilitate world trade post $USD, that someone will set up international gold vaults, staffed by officials from their respective owners, (staff would have diplomatic immunity) in neutral countries, perhaps Dubai and Singapore, where a tokenized gold backed crypto (one miligram/microgram) per digital token could be used for international exchange purposes and the amounts oculd be settled within those neutral vaults. For all intents, it is exceedingly difficult (and expensive) for an individual to LEGALLY transfer one million dollars (less than ONE LITER in volume (13kg) in physical gold across international borders.

There is a simple realisation that Crypto decided to be shit. LINK was meant to be an investment in all crypto success with exponentially less risk. at least, thats why i bought LINK and went all in. Nothing could be successful and realised without LINK, hence its better to just invest in LINK that have all the risk of picking other projects. Well? crypto did not care to be a success. it has actually regRESSED since 2018. The industry chose to capitulate to scams, memes, gambling, and all the related. You do not need Oracles for that. It's not like i'm shitting on LINK and praising other shit. There have been colossal failures with LINK specifically too which greatly exaggerated this downfall, but this is the bottom line. Sergey scaling his company to 600+ people was one of them. He may have anticipated a crypto industry that never actually came to be, so expanded way too aggressively.... for a market of scams and memes instead of what he thought it would grow into by now... which is a fucking gargantuan drain on resources for him now. At the end of the day, we all made the same mistake as Sergey. we believed in better. we expected more than a regression with the industry.","refusal":null,"role":"assistant"}],"tools":[],"split":"TRAIN"}

And this is what happened, and you can see it in all the formerly Christian countries. Modern Christian apologists literally argue that if not the Bible, then what? They don't know.

Again, you never once refuted any of my accusations against buddhism's annihilationist praxis (because you can't).

Oh but wait, Ripple itself says the ledger is immutable. Surely they wouldn't lie so blatantly, right? Well, they're not lying, they just being very deceptive about their narrow meaning of \"immutable.\" What they're saying is that once a new ledger is issued, that ledger is considered immutable. And then once they put the next ledger together, that should be considered immutable too. Great. And largely worthless, since it doesn't matter if past ledgers exist or not, let alone whether they're immutable, as evidenced by XRP \"losing\" over 32,000 of its earliest ledgers. Again, please look this up if this seems strange, or not English enough to your taste. The only part that matters are the rules governing the transition from one \"immutable\" ledger to the next \"immutable\" ledger. If those rules were strictly enforced, it would be impossible for the XRP \"blockchain\" to float 32,000+ ledgers off the ground. You either have a valid state from the ground up, or it's all made up. In Ripple's case, it's emphatically the latter scenario. This is problematic, among other reasons, because the validators get to collectively choose what is a valid transition. If we get a magic 80% of validators to agree that your wallet is empty, and mine just grew by the amount you lost, then that's what happens. You'd better hope the validators never feel like that's something that needs to happen. As to the \"trust\" part, Ripple itself doesn't bother pretending it's not a fundamental part of their design, but they claim instead it's a good thing to rely on somehow, despite being one of the critical aspect Bitcoin and all plausible cryptocurrencies made a point to remove. The trusted UNL lists 99% of nodes rely on is fine to deal with occasional rogue validators. It is woefully inadequate to protect from attacks where most validators decide or are coerced into colluding. And there's the post limit, so fuck it. You get it, or you don't.

Well I can tell you what I did. I did experiment with backtesting some automated trading algos but I wasn't actually confident enough with any of their results to use one, so I didn't actually end up putting those in my bot. The bot itself ended up as more of just a fancy frontend for deribit. Picrel, I think it looks really good for how beginner of a programmer I was & it taught me a fUCK TON of shit. I just used pyqt for the frontend, and also managed to write a little .bat script to process the qt files into usable python so I would just have to run one batch script every time I modified the Qt frontend in qt studio, and it'd spit out a file ready to run in my greater python script. The script itself I had to learn how to use asyncio and run everything concurrently so the GUI wouldn't hitch and the websockets connections would run all smoothly. On the GUI I wanted to have a lot of visual indicators, so I built in price feeds in different currencies (USD/BTC/ETH) as well as suggested price levels where I could set limit orders at various incremented %'s up and down the levels of the orderbook. The kind of crown jewel of the project was the limit chaser. Back in those days all the big bitcoin margin exchanges would normally charge like 0.075% per market order, but if instead you created liquidity on the books by making limit orders, you would GET PAID a 0.025% maker rebate upon successfully getting your order lifted off the book by someone else. What if you want to get the maker rebate, but also get your order filled as soon as possible? Well it has to be close to the spread of course. So what the limit chaser did was submit a limit order right above or below the market price, directly on the spread. And then keep querying the API every couple milliseconds to see if the market moved. The minimum tick on deribit was $0.50, so if the price level moved up by that much I'd cancel the current order and (cont.)"},{"content":"(cont) simply submit a new one at the new, current price level. Again directly at the spread, so basically I'd be close to the first to make a new order at that level, at the top of the queue, and thus be most likely to have my order filled before everyone else's. It worked fucking great, I made some money back on all my orders, and actually since it's 0.025% back in your pocket, that gives you a 0.05% buffer if the market starts really turning against you all of a sudden and you want to market dump out of your position (0.075% taker fee - (-0.025% maker fee)). Anyway depends on what you want to do exactly but even if you do want something automated, you could make a really simple CLI program that hooks to your fav exchange's API and just runs even a simple RSI strat or whatever if you want. Can use tradingview + pinescript to test more advanced strategies. As far as the actual tech goes just use whatever language you already know. For me that was python and python is easy as fuck, plus I was under no illusions that I was going to need the RAW BLISTERING SPEED of a lower-level language..... python was just fine. I never would've made as much progress if I had to learn some crazy esoteric 1337 systems level language at the same time anyway. And btw I'm not sure if you're thinking of doing this in some tradfi exchange but personally I would fucking never, with the taxes & what not. I loved trading crypto because the market is stupid fast and wild and plus I doubt there's any boomer tradfi exchanges that let you do >25x leverage which I greatly enjoyed playing with and keeping a close eye on with my bot.

Thjink of the amount of value going into dark markets where people are buying crazy shit to fuel their x1000 gains with liquor, coke and whores. Okay fine so they use XMR to make these purchases which explains the premium because they want to remain anonymous. Butt the XMR is going somewhere, obviously to merchants selling these products. If you spend sometime on the Dork Web you see that the number of merchants offering these warez is several orders of magnitdude less than the people buying them.

The plan for Storm was already ready in '93, but the Americans prevented it because they were convinced that Croatia could not return it by military means, as they openly told Tudjman and Šušak. Only after Srebrenica we get the green light. Tudjman and Šušak openly mocked the Americans in Dayton for their wrong assessment. You can read all this and more in Hoolbrooke's memoirs, which you can find online in Croatian. Secondly, the Storm was not planned in 5 minutes and it was not an ordinary action because the key was to place the artillery on Dinara from where Knin can be seen as if in the palm of your hand. The Croatian army first had to seize that area from the Serbs, and then build a road to the top of the mountain in harsh mountain winter conditions. This went on for months. Even if the Americans planned that operation, I don't see any problem - the Croatian army carried out that attack, and you ran away like cowards, so that in the end even Milosevic himself mocked you.

Originally, their business model revolved around producing and selling ASIC miners. This strategy was adopted to initiate the cryptocurrency with a \"fair launch\", emulating the approach taken by Bitcoin. However, they faced regulatory challenges, and their plan hit a major stumbling block when they observed the trajectories of the cryptocurrencies Internet Computer (ICP) and Helium (HNT).\nBoth ICP and HNT had similar models, capitalizing on both the hardware sales and the token offerings - akin to selling picks and shovels during a gold rush. The backlash Helium received due to their monopoly over the 5G router sales, which many perceived as unfair, tarnished their reputation.\nThis prompted DAGlabs to reconsider their approach. In response, they dissolved the company and launched Kaspa, positioning it as the \"world's fastest crypto\", the \"world's first blockDAG\", and emphasizing its \"no premine\", \"no ICO\", and \"no VC\" stance. This narrative resonated well, especially during the bear market.\nHowever, what they didn't publicize was the establishment of a Chinese registered company named Iceriver, which pioneered the production of the first-ever ASICs for Kaspa. They used these asics to mine a lot of coins when the competition they faced only had gpu’s farms. After they had mined enough coins and sold all their asics they dissolved the company because they knew they could not compete with bitmain. \nIt is true that their was no premine and no ICO, but because they used asic miners way before the masses they accumulated a huge amount of coins."},{"content":">2024 >dagshit","refusal":null,"role":"assistant"}],"tools":[],"split":"TEST"}

I took some profits, put it into the WRONG choices in the name of \"diversity\" and I should have sold more. I had a sell target in my head that I would sell everything and walk away. I did not hit that. For me it was Fantom at $4. I thought it would hit that, seemed so then close, but then it just took a beating and pounding and fell. I'm still optimistic that fantom will head back to a similar range next bullrun. Price action for fantom is pretty good at this point in time. I think the floor might still be in the 50-60 cent range. Overall, I'd like to try and hit $2m before I seriously start looking to change my strategy. I'm fully employed, making half decent money, and I might be getting a promotion soon. I've set up myself to have a decent safety net fund of 6-12 months, I have more stable investments I contribute to, so I can afford to play degenerate for big numbers. I don't really buy crypto at this moment in time and I don't really plan to until I shore up other finances so there's less of a gap between my index funds, retirement account, debt, OTHER crypto, and fantom. I think it'd suck if it crashed to zero, but I just don't see a world where fantom goes to zero and everything else in the space is peachy other than buttcoin.

Those tweets did not result in buy pressure, and the reason why is when they search for squid they see squid game. CMC fast track was paid for and applied to.

The people who will disagree with what I'm getting at here, are generally low-info latecomer normies who skipped the part where they spend sufficient time learning about bitcoin, and so started speculating like all crypto are interchangeable candies.

Nothing could be successful and realised without LINK, hence its better to just invest in LINK that have all the risk of picking other projects.

Outside of niche (Star Citizen is probably the most demanding, PC only-and-fuck-you-never-watered-down for-console space sim and is a combination of lack of alpha optimization and exceptionally detailed engine and gameworld, that stresses the GPU hardware in a way that Crysis did back in the day but also stresses RAM, CPU, and SSD), stuff, it's a good thing that you don't need the latest top end card to run a game at high settings on average, but we DO have some major issues with optimization overall. For instance, all the devs with ray tracing and other garbage optimization stuff that drops the FPS on even high end cards, yet there's a \"We can use DLSS/FSR/XESS\" escape hatch so nobody ever holds them to account for their stupidity with titles like Alan Wake 2. There's no bloody reason to make your single player game obnoxiously badly optimized and require DLSS to get a playable framerate, but that's its own issue. Aside from this, oldfag /g/entlemen know that you don't need to upgrade every generation. You upgrade when you need it to what you can afford and what you think will hold you for a long time. For instance, I had a 1070 and it kept me going up until the 3090 (which I got right before crypto+pandemic price hikes so I got an Asus Strix, the only NV AIB worth it for a 3090 at the time over a Founder's Edition, for $1650. Before long it would sell officially upwards of $2300 ). I got it because of both a mining interest and because of a lack of AMD founders edition 6800XT / 6900XT, but had I been able to get one of those $650 6800XT's I probably would have done that, as for gaming it was a phenomenal card and a great value; even better on Linux.

The Riddler is likely a professional, more than we're being led to believe because if you look at his crypto wallet that was leaked by DMs with the guy trying to buy The Mark Hotel tape, you will see that over $2M has moved through his account in the last year, with $630k moving in and out in the past 36 hours. Theory 2 (Max Schizo): The Riddler is threatening AK and Drake with murder by saying he'll look at his legal options with this lawyer who specializes in getting niggers off of murder charges. He never once said sue and what could he even sue for? I think it was a coded threat. His easiest target would be AK especially since the bro kept dropping his address when he got mad on stream today.

Java and C# are widely used general-purpose programming languages that are fairly similar to each other. Scala is a language running on the Java virtual machine, so it makes sense as a counterpart to Reimu's Java. Not sure about Youmu being Clojure. Might have something to do with Reimu and Sanae also being languages that run on the JVM. C++ is a very fast general-purpose language with a huge amount of functionality, so it fits a maid that can stop time. Kanako being Python should be pretty obvious. I think Nitori is C because it's a language for nerds? SQL is used for querying databases, which are kind of like libraries. I don't know enought about Go to say why it's given to Miko. I think's an analogy between Go's focus on concurrency and Miko's ability. Rust tries to enforce (judge) code safety. Koishi is Brainfuck. I think that speaks for itself. Solidity is used for some crypto stuff. GLSL is used to write shaders for graphics programming. Scratch is an educational language for children. Aya is Swift because she's a bird. JavaScript is stereotypically a language for zoomers. Erlang has a general philosophy of letting threads crash and restarting them when needed instead of recovering from failures, kind of like Mokou's reincarnation. Malbolge is an esoteric language that's meant to be impossible to program in. Lua is a very lightweight language often embedded into other applications. LilyPond is used to generating sheet music. R and Julia are languages used for statistics. Fortran and COBOL are some of the oldest languages still in use.

The initial network has to tap into this entropy of trust left over from the non-deterministic world. In other words, it can't be decentralized initially unless the network wants to go through a growth period where bad behavior is actually game-theory optimal (with asymptotic approach to trustworthy behavior). Human beings being what they are, such a period would sour people against the use of smart contracts if they could be scammed early on, even if they were safer than conventional alternatives. For an example of this look at common perception of bitcoin. It has provided 24/7 value transfer at discount rates since its launch 10 years ago. During that time billions have been transferred without loss. On top of that it has increased in value from less than a dollar to over a thousand dollars. Any stock, bond or precious metal that did that would be hailed as the greatest investment in the history of the world. But human perception matters. For that reason the chainlink network cannot launch decentralized and must launch with as much provider/node transparency as possible. This sets the floor for node behavior when the network does decentralize. Only though doing it this way will people, with all their flaws, see the value. Put another way: the only way to successfully launch any oracle network is from the top down with respect to real-world trust. If you could launch a perfectly coded, perfectly transparent, perfectly decentralized oracle network right now you would still lose to chainlink. An oracle network must first have the buy in (and implicit pledge to perform) of those agencies with the most real world trust. The network which harvests these residual trust sources from the real world is the one that wins, and the one that wins is the de facto monopoly because those that can't harvest this resource must traverse the sybil period to launch.","refusal":null,"role":"assistant"}],"tools":[],"split":"TRAIN"}

LEARN from the losses.  nah  0.5-1% for scalps. 3-5% for swings. i trim pretty early on to lock in profits, so even tho the difference between entry and exit may be like 120%, the actual profit i make is closer to 40-60% since i've already exited so much. my TP methodology is different for scalps vs swings as well,but it's basic stuff anyone can do.  im not a financial advisor. when u become desperate, you begin to look for any way to make money.

Java and C# are widely used general-purpose programming languages that are fairly similar to each other. Scala is a language running on the Java virtual machine, so it makes sense as a counterpart to Reimu's Java. Not sure about Youmu being Clojure. Might have something to do with Reimu and Sanae also being languages that run on the JVM. C++ is a very fast general-purpose language with a huge amount of functionality, so it fits a maid that can stop time. Kanako being Python should be pretty obvious. I think Nitori is C because it's a language for nerds? SQL is used for querying databases, which are kind of like libraries. I don't know enought about Go to say why it's given to Miko. I think's an analogy between Go's focus on concurrency and Miko's ability. Rust tries to enforce (judge) code safety. Koishi is Brainfuck. I think that speaks for itself. Solidity is used for some crypto stuff. GLSL is used to write shaders for graphics programming. Scratch is an educational language for children. Aya is Swift because she's a bird. JavaScript is stereotypically a language for zoomers. Erlang has a general philosophy of letting threads crash and restarting them when needed instead of recovering from failures, kind of like Mokou's reincarnation. Malbolge is an esoteric language that's meant to be impossible to program in. Lua is a very lightweight language often embedded into other applications. LilyPond is used to generating sheet music. R and Julia are languages used for statistics. Fortran and COBOL are some of the oldest languages still in use.

(I apologize in advance for my b1-b2 eng) I recently found out about stock itself, investment and what more important *percent’s*. I'm thinking of starting throwing money in screen and currently building *long-term* portfolio. From the brief analyze of investments I decided that the best option for me would be mainly focusing on ETF indexes. I divided total 100% investment portfolio by splitting it into low/mid/high (at my own subjective view) risk and trying to diversify (a bit) by economy sectors: 1) 25% [[low mid]] risk: 17,5% - QQQ (49% tech) 7,5% - FNILX (31% tech) 2) 65% [[mid risk]]: 40% - USD (100% tech) 12,5% - URA (71.17% energy, 18.63% industrial, 8.96% materials) 12,5% - ITB (73.52% Consumer cyclical, 19.02% industrials, 7.46% materials) 3) 10% [[high risk]] (yea, I realize that this is not a stock, but a bubble coins): 2,5% - DOGE 2,5% - ETH 2,5% - BTC 2,5% - BNB -For low/mid stocks and their percent part I literally selected from \"most performing ETF indexes over 5 years\" news. -URA and ITB in mid are for some diversification. Most part of USD I gain for it performance. -For high risk I firstly looked for some IPOs, but I haven't found any [i]sexy[/i] IPOs to buy and the whole IPO's theme seems too [i]hazy[/i] for me right now. And as a result, currently ended up in crypto. So, I open to high-risk investment options. -Be aware that the current portfolio is based on one evening \"research\" Rate my portfolio and chances to be fucked up by global economy and stock market? Any advices what I'm doing/thinking wrong? Or maybe what better should I buy? Or what portfolio splitting percentage do you think is better? Also, is there any online calculator which on input takes portfolio stock percentages + growth values of these stocks for some time period and calculates general growth for selected time period?"},{"content":"7/10 TL;DR Low risk and mid risk are mostly perfect. Only issue is high risk. For low risk, SPY / VTI, QQQ, and SCHD is probably the best combination. I like your QQQ considering the next few decades will be dominated by tech companies. For mid risk, I’d say your choices are phenomenal. The only odd one out is URA, the other 2 are choices I would also go for. For high risk, you’re better off hiring a financial advisor to trade for u. But if you decide to go with a bank, do your research. Just because it’s a bank, doesn’t mean they can make money investing. Crypto is a sham. The only “investment” in crypto is buying and holding BTC, and that’s it. Every other coin is filled with bugs, problems, ethical concerns and rug pulls issues. If you’re feeling super super high risk, then yeah. Those coins are just about right. Enough market cap and reputability to not be a scam, but not solid enough to have a good reason to grow. That’s the thing about crypto. Projects that have actual uses and have good backing are not doing well, and coins that have no actual reason to be worth anything at all are doing good. Like doge. Also, if you don’t mind me asking, how much capital total have you invested? As for the calculator ur looking for, I believe it’s the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) calculator.  Health care is not being talked about as much right now since generative AI is in its infancy and can make mistakes. Making mistakes in writing essays and parsing normal data? Not a problem. Making mistakes In medical diagnoses, patient recommendations, prescriptions dosages, and emergency response recommendations. Those are places where generative AI cannot afford to fuck up. And we know that the current models, no matter how perfect, are still prone to issues even when trained to the utmost degree. That could potentially change with gpt5 coming out and Sam Altman claiming that it’ll make gpt4 seem stupid.","refusal":null,"role":"assistant"}],"tools":[],"split":"TRAIN"}

Turned out nothing cared for doing that anyway, which is why its devolved to memes. Chainlink made many mistakes but they cant really do much about tht. I will say that Sergey made a similar mistake to us(but not a forgivable one in his position) of assuming the industry would screw want to grow and then need Chainlink technologies to do so. He scaled his company too much towards expecting that. So now he has 650 on the payroll, and has been dumping for years to fund that anticipating a market which doesn’t exist. That has exaggerated the poor performance, but its not like other serious projects aren’t doing shit. Just less shit because they had the foresight not to hyper scale as they probably knew this was potentially on the horizon. It’s got to the point i’d much rather invest my money in my own business these days. Incan triple what i invest just flipping shit on the side. The margin is ok. Its not a 10x. Not a 20x.

I was obsessed with \"the top\" back then. As I said, the duress of just the general shit going on with losing my job, some personal shit, made my judgement insanely clouded. I had never experienced this before. I'd be happy as a pickle if I had sold back then. I think the entire 4 years were a great lesson for me. It's really changed how I allocate my portfolio. I now am pretty iron clad with my stable side of my pond and retirement. That's let me plan more long term, but take greater risks with other assets. I'd like to build my wealth as fast as possible, but I don't want to risk it all on red or black. I now have a plan in case life does go wrong (lose my job? ok, drain savings -> Take profits if I'm massively up, else try and drain from the stable investments taking less of a beating). I have tried to construct a portfolio that can allow me to weather severe economic turmoil. That alone has granted me a lot of peace of mind.\nAs far as the rest though? It's hard to say. I believe I'm more capable of recognizing my own euphoria and depression. I was still young when I had that level of money. Life hadn't gotten too real. It didn't feel real. So I made bad calls. \"No way it can ever get that bad\" and then it got much worse. I now realize I can be comfortable NOT hitting the top. Take your winnings, be patient, wait for the right opportunity. Create your targets, stick with it, walk away. I have a tendency to still go halfsies. When I trade options, I usually always cash out half whenever I 2x my money. Same with other shit. I do believe I am a bit married to my bags. No hiding it. But I do think I'm more practical now about gains, and I sell some from time to time just to continue locking in profits. I think that's the best thing I've learned. Take more profits.

No crypto currency is ready for world class adoption because it all sucks ass. Cryptocurrencies by definition is unregulated and decentralized, so it'll never be adopted by any nation for any large scale uses. And if it is, it'll be to use like currency, not for utility. And just like with any transaction, you'll be taxed on those purchases which means there will be a paper trail to some extent which defeats the whole purpose of crypto. Any 'utility' based coins based off of ETH blockchain or any other shitcoin will all inevitably fail. Look how niche use cases are for these coins and yet gas fees and transaction fees already bite u in the ass.

If they can get generation of 3d models, animations, and environments working more smoothly you could easily generate whatever open world sandbox you want, with whatever enemies you want along with NPCs with endless dialog. It would simply need to generate a description of their goals and personality then store it. Main limitations are that it would have difficulty with gameplay mechanics and systems. So it would hard to be generate a drivable vehicle, for example, without human intervention, but if you preprogrammed the systems for it, it would be easy for it to generate whatever custom type of vehicle model you want on top of an existing framework. Same thing for weapons and objects, it would need the framework for physics and use but could generate whatever you want on top of that. It could also do descriptions and stats but could need intervention for balancing. It may not be able to do environment effects and cinematics but i'd expect they will also be possible eventually. I'd bet on it killing the open world ubislop genre within 10 years. Since they are already leaning on AI and it will ultimately just be easier to generate your own game and cut out the woke propagandized middle man. Which imo is a good thing since it's already gone to shit anyway. People can cry all they want about wanting to stay cavemen and crush rocks with their skull but the opportunity is here.
